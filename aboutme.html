    <h2>Who I Am</h2>
    <p>
      Hi, I’m Kabir. I’m a Babson College student interested in business, strategy, and learning how to build useful
      projects with technology. I like working on structured problem-solving and turning ideas into real outcomes.
    </p>

    <h2>What I’m Learning</h2>
    <p>
      Right now I’m taking a “coding with AI” class, so I’m learning the basics of HTML/CSS and how to use AI tools to
      help me build, debug, and improve my work. My goal is to get comfortable making simple, clean websites and small apps.
    </p>

    <h2>Interests</h2>
    <div class="box">
      <p><b>Sports:</b> Football, cricket, and basketball.</p>
      <p><b>Business:</b> Entrepreneurship, strategy, and real-world case studies.</p>
      <p><b>Tech:</b> AI tools, automation, and creating things that are practical.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>What’s Next</h2>
    <p>
      I want to keep building a portfolio of projects—starting with personal websites and class projects—and then move into
      more interactive sites that use JavaScript for data, schedules, and simple features.
